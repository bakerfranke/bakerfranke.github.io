<TD><FONT SIZE="+1">What was the problem with this year's student government? 
Well, there were a few, but I have solutions, answers and a direction to take
student government.  Right now Student Government is somewhat akin to the
Millennium Falcon (Han Solo's ship).  It has the ability to make the Kessel run
in under twelve parsecs, but at the present moment it is &quot;a hunk of junk&quot;
(Princess Leia to Han).  In other words, Student Government once was, and still
can be a well run organization, but some renovations and new parts are needed.

of the major problems this year was that the assembly meetings were not run well
at all.  (No offense Zack, and Dan).  The president must be at least remotely
familiar with our school's constitution, and &quot;Robert's Rules of Order.&quot;
 Having worked with this year's cabinet in an effort to revamp the student
handbook, I became increasingly familiar with the constitution, and being
Student Senate Head, a Senate representative for three years, I am also well
versed in &quot;Robert's Rules of Order.&quot;  Most of you saw this year that I
am capable of running the meetings, during our interim stints. 
<FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B>If elected efficient meetings will be a constant.</B></FONT>
 Folks, this does not mean boredom.  <FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B>I will work to
make meetings interesting</B></FONT>, but to do that we can not get caught up in
confusion about procedure.  I won't let it happen.</TD></TR>

problem, well not really a problem, but a concern of mine is that I hear so many
good ideas for proposals just walking around school, and most of them never
materialize.  <FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B>As President I would institute the &quot;suggestion
session&quot;</B></FONT> in Student government-A five-minute period once in a
while where people would <FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B>just shout out ideas.</B></FONT>
 The secretary would write them down, and then I would post them on the Student
Government bulletin board, incase anybody wanted to take the idea and write it
up.</TD></TR>

of the reasons that this year's Presidents probably had so much difficulty was
because neither Zack nor Dan really had a chance to get in the flow.  Both came
into the cabinet amidst a torrent of projects already underway, and neither had
time to adjust.  <FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Being a member of the cabinet this
year I am already in the flow.</B></FONT>  I know what I'm doing.  If elected
Student Government would have jump-start at the end of this year, and I'd just
keep it rolling into next year.  <FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B>I know what it takes
to get this government going</B></FONT>, and if elected a period of adjustment
wouldn't be necessary.  One of the most successful Presidents in Parker history,
Greg Feldman, was Student Senate Head before becoming President.  I believe that
part of the reason that he was so successful was that he knew what to do as soon
as he was elected, and got things going right away.  I believe that the same
would happen to me.</TD></TR>

<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><IMG
SRC="http://www.tezcat.com/~bfranke/images/a.gif" ALT="A" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="50">lso,
I know for a fact that communication between the president and the
administration this year (until very recently) was virtually non-existent (Zack
and Dan see Paragraph 1, line 2).  Not only am I more than willing to discuss
issues with the Administration, but I am not intimidated either. 
<FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B>I am willing to fight (and I mean fight) for
students' rights, beliefs, and proposals.</B></FONT></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><IMG
SRC="http://www.tezcat.com/~bfranke/images/l.gif" ALT="L" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="50">astly,
this year's Student Government had no direction - no purpose.  Student
Government is a place where students have the power to change the school.  The
way those changes are made cannot be through strict procedure; it's not
conducive to progressive thought.  I would like to bring to Student Government
what I brought to Senate - a loose atmosphere that gets things done.  If things
get rowdy (as they did a few times this year) I believe that I have the ability
to control the situation.  Again this doesn't have to be done by strict
procedure.  <FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B>So let's have a looser government that
produces, rather than a government that keeps trying to tighten its grip as all
of the creativity slips through its fingers.</B></FONT></TD></TR>
