# Ignore hosts block, you might want to ignore the local sites.
# THIS IS A REQUIRED BLOCK. If you do not want to ignore any hosts from
# counting, just put { on one line and } on the next line but make sure
# the braces exist!
######
#
# wildcard can be used to ignore a entire domain, if the IP address starts   
# with a number >= 192 and <= 223, the network is Class C, to ignore the
# entire domain of class C, put a * at the 4th octet like,
# 192.134.144.*
# if the IP address starts with a number >= 128 and <= 191, the network class
# is B, to ignore the entire domain of class B, put a * at the 3rd octet like,
# 128.116.* or 128.116.*.*
# if  the IP address starts with a number < 128, the network class is A
# to ignore the entire domain of class A, put a * at the 2nd octet like,
# 20.* or 20.*.*.*
#
# you can use the full IP address for a specific host ofcourse, but if
# wildcard exist for this domain, it will take precedence
#
{
}
# Auth block
# all possible names and IP addrees of your host can be referred.
