Science Self Study

       Our group discussed how Parker's science program has many problems.
The new lab period is not being used for lab time, and is instead used for
other work that is painfully boring and can be done at home.  Also, with all
the money that was spent on computers and example models, the students hardly
ever get a chance to use them.  Some feel that the use of fetal pigs and other
animals for dissection is a waste of life.  Models and computer programs could
be put to good use to teach students the same anatomy.  The new tenth grade
science program combining biology, physics, and physical science frustrates
many of the underclassmen.  They feel that because of the amount of material
involved with the course, they don't have time to reasonably learn the
information.  We also discussed how Parker courses do not adequetly prepare
students for science tests outside of Parker such as SAT II tests.  While
there are some good aspects about the science program, we feel that many
changes need to be made in order to create a more positive learning
environment.
