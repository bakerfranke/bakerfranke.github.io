Visual Arts

	Students in the Visual Arts discussion group were eager to share
their ideas regarding new course possibilities and showed their general
content with the amount of work being displayed throughout the school.
The vast majority of the complaints were about Photo 1 and students voiced
their opinions about how to improve it.  Students felt that most of the
classes were fine but stressed their need to have a wider selection in the
future.  A shocking number of sudents whole-heartedly supported the
addition of some sort of film class.  Overall, students were happy with
teh Visual Arts Department and only wnated to fine-tune some of the
courses.
