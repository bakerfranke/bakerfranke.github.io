History Department

	We talked primarily about tracking in the History department.  One
suggestion was that the required courses in the department were tracked.
This led to a discussion about the pros and cons of tracking more courses
in general.  It was also suggested that teachers should have the final
word in in who is allowed to take an AP course, as opposed to a score on
an entrance exam.  In contrast, some students felt that it was solely up
to the student in question, and if he/she wanted to take an AP course,
they should be allowed to, regardless of scores, grades, or previous
performance.  Another topic which occupied our time was a problem which
seems most evident in the history department: apathy on the part of the
student body.  The lack of enthusiasm and participation worried most
people in our group.  Some suggested that teachers make classes more
interesting and invite student participation more frequently in order to
raise student interest levels.
