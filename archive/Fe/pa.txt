Performing Atrs 

	Our self-study group discussions revealied that the students at
Parker suffer from lack of opportunity to perform.  They wich for more
plays, more performances, more varied art classes, more talent shows and
performance showcases without constricting themes, and possibly a
drama/performance club.
	Unfortunately, the students' "demands" (for lack of a better
word), are not likely to come anywhere in the near or even distant future.
Parker, though claiming to be an especially artsy school, pushes the arts
way down on its list of priorities.  The Drama and Music departments are
constantly getting the shaft.  That is why the black-box theater and the
other sorely needed improvements and revisions to the auditorium have been
put off to the point of virtual nonexistence in the rebuilding plans.
This is why the upper school Drama department consists of one person, who
could not possibly single-handedly teach all of the classes that she would
like to offer.  This is why Drama Tech and Special Chorus share one
floating block in the schedule.  That is why there is no Dram classroom
other than the auditorium, which is in constant demand by the rest of the
school.  This is why Grape Jam and Jazz Band have no actual scheduled time
period, and just meet after schol (like extra-curriculars).  That is why
there are no two-semester Drama classes.
	The Drama Department will probably never get the black-box theater
it wants; the Music department will never get the respect and recognition
it wants; the students will never get the extra performances they want as
long as Parker continues to think [publicly]: "Well...it's just art."
