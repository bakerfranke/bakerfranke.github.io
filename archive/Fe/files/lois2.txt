	The day had finally arrived.  Whether this was fortunate, or not for Baker he could not tell.  It was July and as Baker looked out the window of his appartment he thought about every other July that he could remember in his liftime.  July meant it was the middle of summer vacation and school would not be starting for over a month.  But his life would change now.  In June Baker¹s whole family, attended his college graduation, and Baker flew back home to Chicago with his family where he would stay for about a month before moving to Portland, Oregon for his new job.
	Baker had three more day before he had to leave, so he decided that he would invite several of his friends over for dinner before they had to leave too.  Baker would miss his friends, and he wanted to see them all and say goodbye because he probably wouldn¹t see them for a long time.  Baker also had another purpose for organizing the gathering.
	Baker heard the uneven thud of his Grandma Lois walking down the hallway towards the front of the hosue.  Baker, in his years away at college, forgot how much he dreaded the sound of that walk.  He prepared for the inevitable barrage of senseless questions.
	³OOOOOOO Goody!² said Lois.  ³It looks like you¹re all ready for your party.²
	³It¹s not a party, it¹s just some friends comming over.²
	³Oh, whatever.  We¹re going to have so much fun.²  Baker wondered what exactly she meant by `we.¹  ³Oh it¹s going to be marvelous.  Just fabulous!  Did you remember to call all of your friends?²
	³Of course I called them,² replied Baker trying to show a level of irritation in his voice that might send a message that he really didn¹t want to be bothered.  It would have been true of everyone, though.  He didn¹t even feel like talking to his sister, Laura, right now.  He just had a lot to think about.
	³Well, are you sure they¹re comming?²
	³They¹re comming.²
	³Well, you can never be sure at times like this.  I¹ve told you the story about 	Annabell and George.²  Baker hated this type of question.  She didn¹t really ask because Lois had learned over the years that question can be answered with a yes or a no, and more often than not she wouldn¹t get to tell her story.²
	³As a matter of fact I have
	³Well, George was having a huge wedding party for himself and Annabell, I mean huge.  HE had a tent errected in his back yard, 

	One night in June, a few days before his family arrived for graduation, Baker had dinner out at a nice restaurant with Christina and proposed to her.
