}\pard \ql \sl240 {\f22 \tab The day had finally arrived.  Whether this was fortunate, or not for Baker he could not tell.  It was July and as Baker looked out the window of his appartment he thought about every other July that he could remember in his liftime.  July meant it was the}{\f22  middle of summer vacation and school would not be starting for over a month.  But his life would change now.  In June Baker\'d5s whole family, attended his college graduation, and Baker flew back home to Chicago with his family where he would stay for about }{\f22 a month before moving to Portland, Oregon for his new job.\par 
}\pard \ql \sl240 {\f22 \tab Baker had three more day before he had to leave, so he decided that he would invite several of his friends over for dinner before they had to leave too.  Baker would miss his friends, and he wanted to see them all and say goodbye because he probably would}{\f22 n\'d5t see them for a long time.  Baker also had another purpose for organizing the gathering.\par 
}\pard \ql \sl240 {\f22 \tab Baker heard the uneven thud of his Grandma Lois walking down the hallway towards the front of the hosue.  Baker, in his years away at college, forgot how much he dreaded the sound of that walk.  He prepared for the inevitable barrage of senseless question}{\f22 s.\par 
}\pard \ql \sl240 {\f22 \tab \'d2OOOOOOO Goody!\'d3 said Lois.  \'d2It looks like you\'d5re all ready for your party.\'d3\par 
}\pard \ql \sl240 {\f22 \tab \'d2It\'d5s not a party, it\'d5s just some friends comming over.\'d3\par 
}\pard \ql \sl240 {\f22 \tab \'d2Oh, whatever.  We\'d5re going to have so much fun.\'d3  Baker wondered what exactly she meant by `we.\'d5  \'d2Oh it\'d5s going to be marvelous.  Just fabulous!  Did you remember to call all of your friends?\'d3\par 
}\pard \ql \sl240 {\f22 \tab \'d2Of course I called them,\'d3 replied Baker trying to show a level of irritation in his voice that might send a message that he really didn\'d5t want to be bothered.  It would have been true of everyone, though.  He didn\'d5t even feel like talking to his sister, }{\f22 Laura, right now.  He just had a lot to think about.\par 
}\pard \ql \sl240 {\f22 \tab \'d2Well, are you sure they\'d5re comming?\'d3\par 
}\pard \ql \sl240 {\f22 \tab \'d2They\'d5re comming.\'d3\par 
}\pard \ql \sl240 {\f22 \tab \'d2Well, you can never be sure at times like this.  I\'d5ve told you the story about \tab Annabell and George.\'d3  Baker hated this type of question.  She didn\'d5t really ask because Lois had learned over the years that question can be answered with a yes or a no, and}{\f22  more often than not she wouldn\'d5t get to tell her story.\'d3\par
