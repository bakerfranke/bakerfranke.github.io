                A survey! </b></font><font color="#C0C0C0"

                <p><font size="3">That&#146;s right! IS will be
                conducting faculty and staff training. But to
                make it as painless as possible IS wants you to
                rate yourself on various applications to figure
                out exactly what kind of training you want and
                need.</font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><b>Here&#146;s how it works:<br>
                </b></font><font size="3">For each application
                listed there are a series of subjects pertaining
                to that application with the numbers one (1)
                through five (5) listed. If you feel that you are
                good at a certain subject you should place your
                dot in the number one (1) space. If, however, you
                feel that you are bad at a certain subject you
                should place your dot in the number five (5)
                space. Of course you don&#146;t have to say
                whether you&#146;re really bad, or really good,
                that&#146;s what two (2), three (3) and four (4)
                are there for.</font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><b>So it really works like
                this:<br>
                </b></font></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><font size="3">If you&#146;re really good
                        at something and/or you <b><i>don&#146;t
                        want training</i></b> in that subject put
                        your dot in, or towards, the number one
                        (1) spot. </font></li>
                    <li><font size="3">If you&#146;re really bad
                        at a certain subject and/or you <b><i>really
                        want training </i></b>place a dot in, or
                        towards, the number five (5) spot.</font></li>
                    <li><font size="3">Also, don&#146;t be
                        ashamed to admit that you need training
                        in a certain application. We all have to
                        learn some things for the first time. If
                        you <b><i>really need training</i></b>
                        please place a dot in the number five (5)
                        spot.</font></li>

                        application does not apply to the work
                        you do please place a dot in the N/A
                        column.</font></li>
                    <li><font size="3">Also, after you submit the

                </b></font><font size="3">Once you submit the
                survey every dot you filled in gets recorded and
                added, along with everyone else&#146;s survey, to
                a large database wherefrom we will &quot;run the
                numbers&quot; to determine what fields we should
                offer training in. Your comments will be taken
                into consideration as well, so don&#146;t forget
                them. </font></p>
