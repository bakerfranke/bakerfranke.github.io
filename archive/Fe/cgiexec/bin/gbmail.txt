	2. Bugs
	-------
	- Some people have reported that subject is not passed correctly on some systems
	when subject contains more then one word (-s "Hello there" and got only "Hello").
	Since I have tried this on Windows95 and WindowsNT4.0 and everything worked fine
	I don't have a clue what this is all about, so if you have such problem please try
	to include as much as posible information about OS type and version and verrsion
	of CRTDLL.DLL you have installed on your system.
	You will find CRTDLL.DLL in your \windows\system directory if you are using Win95
	or in \winnt\system32 directory if you are using WinNT.
	Also if you have an idea what can be done please feel free to mail me.


	Please send bug reports and sugestions to:

		pack number)
		- How did you invoke gbmail.exe (from command-line or from script, if

	You may include any other information you find relevant (or you think it may be
	relevant) for this problem.
