TO DO list for GBMailer version 1.10

	- I intend to put mail header in separate file.
	This should alow you to use long lists of arguments to To: and Cc:
	fields (some people conplains that their scripts look ugly with
	who-know-how long lines) and to create custom mail headers.

	- I also intend to support attachments in future (maybe not so soon).

Please send your sugestins to:

	gboban@cursor.net
