Wow! I really love this survey.  It's going to be so helpful in everything I do.  I wish I knew how to make stuff like this.

just found out that I had to include name and e-mail address for comment form.

I have no idea what Firstclass is, so I don't know if I want to be trainded on it or not.  Overall, I feel very proficient on my pc; certainly enough so to do my job.  MS Access was not an option, but I do need to learn it.  Also, "cheat sheets" or "tip sheets" to accompany each type of software might even be enough for some programs, especially as upgrades come out-that way I don't have to spend a day in training for something I already know and you don't have to teach it.

1.  I am sure I could use more training in all applications and in Win 95.
As for Windows 95, I am pretty good navigating, so I would not want to go to a training 
hat repeats much that I know.  But it does more than I now do so more training would always be welcome.
2.  The training Mark Medema did for Excel went too fast for me.  I need lots of word in setting up 
formulas.  But I use Excel all the time just to set thing up in chart form.
3.  On Windows 95, one thing I would like to learn is how to change the Start Menu (not the add or take away things)
but to make things closer together or farther apart.  On my laptop, not everything fits, because things are far apart and so I have
to scroll too much.  Things are tighter on my office computer and I like that configuration better.
4.  I think I am very good with Eudora and may have been conservative.  For example, with directories, I just
wasn't sure what you meant, so I put down that I didn't know it, but I may actually know it.  I haven't used filters, but that is by choice.
One thing I would like to learn with Eudora is saving to the hard drive or to a disk so that I don't have to print hard copy but can take things off
the server.
5.  I don't use Word to its full potential and would love to learn more.
6.  Since I have been using Power Point full time for a month, I have gotten very good. There are fine points that I could use training in. For
example, I had trouble setting up a Venn Diagram, but my son drew it for me.  Also, I wonder if there is a faster way to  change vertical
spacing on a slide than changing it one line at a time.  I am sure there must be.  I haven't used the Slide Master and I suspect that may be my answer.
