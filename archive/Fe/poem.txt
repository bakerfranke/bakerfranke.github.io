You didn't understand that we were meant for eachother


I tried, in fact, with all my heart
to describe the notions of my mind
‘Twas on my lips when I had to depart
Once again my heart left behind.

Four years went by without a word
But not one day without the thought
Of how to utter and by you be heard
Sans voiding self-battles I’d fought

Twas as if you knew my very speech
When I opened my mouth, you quivered
But you could not have known my love, my peach
Of an oration undelivered.

You were to be my wife my queen
My model for strong souled perfection
You, my shoulder on which to lean
For only with you do I feel connection.

I tried to say, tried to take your hand
And declare love as child to mother
But I could never make you understand
We two were meant for each other.
