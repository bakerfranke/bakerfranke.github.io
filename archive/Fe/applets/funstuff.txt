Sorry, I'm still working on this page, but it's going to be very cool.  Anything that I find on the internet that interests me will be put here.
<P>
You can probably expect:
<p>
Cool Java Applets
<P>
Cool and funny sound bits
<p>
Links to other cool sites
<p>
Great Web design ideas
<p>
and much much more...
<p>
But I need time to develop this page.
I'm hoping to get my whole site done by August 1.  I don't know how realistic it is but that's what I'm shooting for.

I did put a cool applet below that's fun to look at.  If you're using a mac click on the applet (because it's probably not loading) and click cancel on the little window that pops up.  It's a little bug in the applet, but that should get you going.
<p>
Have Fun Everyone!!!!
